# __CIS353_FinalProject__
Alright, so we have procrastinated this for awhile. There's nothing saying we won't continue to do that, but at least now we know what we should be doing. Since we __LOVE__ bad development practices, we're going to waterfall the shit out of this. 

## __Due Date__:
###### 4/18 

## __Possible Dates to Meet__:
###### 4/7, 4/8, 4/9, 4/14, 4/15, 4/16

## __Todo__:
###### * [] Make corrections to report
* [x] Grammar/wording issues
* [] Schema corrections 
* [] Relational schema corrections
* [] Integrity constraints

###### * [] Build database 
* [] Tables (Complex, Building, Room, Employee, Tenant)
* [] Attributes within each table (see PDF in repo)
* [] Populate with sample data

###### * [] Queries
* [] A join involving at least four relations.

###### * [] Combine queries 
* [] Put all queries into one file like the homework and name it 'project.sql'
* [] Run project.sql
* [] __Change font size to 9__
